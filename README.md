# AI-opt-overview

Embarking on an extensive training journey, this repository covers a spectrum of key topics essential for mastering optimization and programming techniques. It delves into foundational aspects, such as installing Python and associated libraries, as well as getting started with Python. The ideia is to extends to Linear Programming (LP), offering insights into tools like Pyomo and OR-Tools. Additionally, the training delves into advanced areas, including Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP), Nonlinear Programming (NLP), Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP), and explores heuristic approaches like Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization. Constraint Programming, a pivotal aspect of optimization, is also a focal point in this comprehensive program. As participants progress, they will gain a versatile skill set to tackle real-world challenges in optimization and programming.
